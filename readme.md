RssFeedySharp
=============

A super simple RSS reader thingie written in asp.net mvc + angular.js + EntityFramework, mostly to learn 
and experiment with the various frameworks and compare how they do things, as well as give me a place to try out
cool stuff and do dumb stuff in public. 

I hope this will converge on sane ideas as I fiddle, but I'm sure there will be brain-deadedness too. Please, feel free to chastize. :) 

The plan is to create this same app in a bunch of different frameworks/platforms, such as Rails, Play and Express, and who knows how many others 
also even yay! 

Any and all feedback appreciated.
