RssFeedySharp
=============

A super simple RSS reader thingie written in asp.net mvc + angular.js + EntityFramework, mostly to learn and experiement with the various frameworks and compare how they do things.

The plan is to create this same app in a bunch of different frameworks/platforms, such as Rails, Play and Express. Probably others also even yay!
